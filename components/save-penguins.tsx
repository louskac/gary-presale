      "Penguin designated as AP 619 was found abandoned by its colony. Since itâ€™s too young to survive on its own, it was taken to a rescue station, where it will stay until it grows strong enough to be released back into the wild and rejoin the penguin colony in Simon's Town. To support the efforts of this organization and ensure that this young penguin has everything it needs, we decided to adopt it and named him Gary. We are currently discussing the possibility of setting up a webcam to monitor his growth and eventual release.",
